It's assumed you already have ikarus, bher, and Andreas Stuhlmueller's scheme-tools set up on your system.  [fg-dir] is the factor-graphics directory e.g. ~/factor-graphics.  [bher dir] is the bher directory e.g. ~/bher-read-only/

====Modifications to bher source====
1) change bher
  a) open the file [bher dir]/bher
  b) replace the lines 

 call(("cd '%(bher_path)s' && ikarus %(debug)s --r6rs-script '%(compiler)s' " +
 "'%(in_path)s.tmp' '%(out_path)s.tmp' '%(ext)s' %(pretty)s") % settings, verbose)

with 

call(("ikarus %(debug)s --r6rs-script '%(compiler)s' " +
              "'%(in_path)s.tmp' '%(out_path)s.tmp' '%(ext)s' %(pretty)s") % settings, verbose)

2) change desugar.ss
  a) open [bher dir]/church/desugar.ss
  b) modify the line 
(define include-paths  (list "./" "include/" "./church/"))

to be

(define include-paths  (list "./" "include/" "[bher dir]/church/" "[fg-dir]/church/"))

i.e. use the absolute path for your bher directory

3) change header.ss
  a) open [bher dir]/church/header.ss
  b) modify 
(define *lazy* false)

to be

(define *lazy* true)

  c) modify 
(environment '(rnrs)
                          '(rnrs mutable-pairs)
                          '(_srfi :1)
                          '(rename (church external math-env) (sample-discrete discrete-sampler))
                          '(rename (only (ikarus) gensym pretty-print exact->inexact) (gensym scheme-gensym))
                          '(_srfi :19)
                          '(church compiler)
                          '(rnrs eval)  )

to be 

(environment '(rnrs)
                          '(abstract)
                          '(lazy)
                          '(util)
                          '(sym)
                          '(python-fg-lib)
                          '(rnrs mutable-pairs)
                          '(_srfi :1)
                          '(rename (church external math-env) (sample-discrete discrete-sampler))
                          '(rename (only (ikarus) gensym pretty-print exact->inexact) (gensym scheme-gensym))
                          '(_srfi :19)
                          '(church compiler)
                          '(rnrs eval))

4) change compiler.ss
  a) open [bher dir]/church/compiler.ss
  b) modify
  (define *lazy* false)

to be

  (define *lazy* true)

  c) modify 
  (church-sexpr  `(begin
                            (load "standard-preamble.church")
                            (load "xrp-preamble.church")
                            (load "mcmc-preamble.church")
                            ,@top-list))

to be 

(church-sexpr  `(begin
                            (load "standard-preamble.church")
                            (load "xrp-preamble.church")
                            (load "mcmc-preamble.church")
                            (load "factor-graph.church")
                            (load "beam-learning.church")
                            ,@top-list))

5) change header-ikarus.sc
  a) open [bher dir]/scheme-compilers/header-ikarus.sc
  b) add the following inside the import form (e.g. after (rnrs eval)
 (lazy)
 (abstract)
 (util)
 (sym)
 (python-fg-lib)
 (churchpytest)

6) change python-fg-lib
  a) open [fg-dir]/scheme/python-fg-lib.ss
  b) modify 

(define fg-dir "/home/ih/factor-graphics/")	

to be

(define fg-dir "[fg-dir]/")	
where fg-dir is your directory for factor-graphics.  Make sure to end the directory with '/' e.g. /home/ih/factor-graphics/


====PATH INFORMATION====


You'll want to have the following paths on the PATH and IKARUS_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables.  [inst dir] is the directory containing factor-graphics.  I'm not sure about the exact syntax for your system, but it'll probably be something like this...

PATH=$PATH:[bher dir]:.


IKARUS_LIBRARY_PATH=[fg-dir]/scheme:[scheme-tools dir]:[bher dir]:.
here scheme-tools dir is the directory containing scheme-tools.

====TESTING SETUP====
To see if everything works you can do the following
$cd [fg-dir]/church/tests
$ bher factor-graph-tests.church
$ bher beam-learning-tests.church

(note: due to path issues you currently have to run bher from the directory containing the church file being run if it uses eval)
